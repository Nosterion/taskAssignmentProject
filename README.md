# taskAssignmentProject

Functionality:

    We can add tasks from a central pool to member's lists by clicking on the assign button
    and selecting the target member list from the dropdown menu.

    We can add new tasks using the appropriate field by entering text and hitting enter.

    We can remove tasks by hovering over an item and clicking on the red trashbin icon.
    Removing items possible from both central pool and from member's list.

    By pressing the plus sign on the central pool's header we can toggle input field on and off.
